# devise-i18n-views

I18n support and translations for **[Devise v2.+](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)** views.

## Install

Add the following line to your `Gemfile`

``` rb
gem 'devise-i18n-views'
```

and run `bundle install`.

Then you need to install the required translations in your `config/locales`. You can do this either manually (downloading them from [devise-i18n-views/locales](https://github.com/mcasimir/devise-i18n-views/tree/master/locales)) or through the apposite generator `devise:views:locale`, eg.

``` sh
rails g devise:views:locale it
```

will generate `config/locales/devise.views.it.yml`.
